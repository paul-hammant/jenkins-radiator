p. This project provides a build pipeline radiator for Jenkins. It
supports separate pipelines from a single Jenkins installation. For
example you can use this to show a pipeline for the mainline of the
application as well as the current release branch.

h2. Description

p. The radiator is organized around three concepts: builds, smoke tests
and regression tests A build is the first step in the pipeline. Once
it completes it triggers smoke tests. Once smoke tests complete they
trigger regression tests. Smoke tests are identified by "S" while
regression tests are identified by "R".

p. This is intended to be viewable by an entire team from a distance.
Colors provide a quick way to determine the current state of the
pipeline.

h2. Colors

p. In progress builds are colored BLUE.
Successful builds are colored GREEN.
Failed or Unstable builds are colored RED.

p. A build is considered in progress until either a smoke or regression
tests fails or until all smoke and regression tests pass.


h2. Settings

To get started create a settings_local.py under jenkins_radiator/ and
define the following Python variables:

# The full URL to your hudson installation. Example: 
HUDSON_URL = 'http://hudson.example.com/hudson/'

# Regex pattern for builds. Example:
HUDSON_BUILD_NAME_PATTERN = '_Build'

# Regex pattern for tests. Example:
HUDSON_TEST_NAME_PATTERN = '_Test_'

# Regex pattern for moke builds. Subset of the above. Example:
HUDSON_SMOKE_NAME_REGEX = re.compile('Smoke|Baseline', re.I)

# Regex pattern for projects to hide from the radiator. Example:
HUDSON_TEST_IGNORE_REGEX = ''

# Default number of build to show in the radiator
HUDSON_BUILD_COUNT = 10


h2. Dependencies

You need to install Django 1.2 or greater. See Option 1 at
http://www.djangoproject.com/download/

The project has no additional dependencies if running under Python
2.6.


h2. Local development

To start the development Django server run python manage.py runserver
from within jenkins_radiator. Now point your browser at
http://localhost:8000/radiator/project_name/ where project_name is the
name of your project.


h2. Deployment

The Django development server is single-threaded and not appropriate
for anything other than simple development. For deployment information
